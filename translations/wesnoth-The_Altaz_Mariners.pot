"- Your ship's figurehead is a magical mascot that protects and empowers your crew. Whenever you recall a unit there is a chance it will receive a temporary bonus or a permanent blessing - depending on the figurehead. This happens every time a unit is recalled, even if they are recalled on land. Figureheads can be changed at any time as long as you have access to your ship (by right-clicking on the bow, i.e. the right-most hex of your ship's deck). Once a unit has been blessed it will receive no further benefits from that figurehead."

"- In this campaign your character improves at fighting every time he attacks an enemy unit. Put simply, the damage of an attack increases the more you use it.\n"
" \n"
"- An attack will increase by +1 damage when you have opted to use it a certain number of times. Attacks with a high number of strikes will take longer to increase than those with few strikes. Only offensive combat counts towards improving attack damage.\n"
" \n"
"- When an attack's damage increases every subsequent bonus will take 20% longer to achieve. For example, if it takes you 10 rounds of combat to increase the damage of your 'swing' attack, it will take 12 more fights to earn the next bonus - and so on.\n"
" \n"
"- Weapon stats do not improve when your character levels up, instead you gain an additional special attack. This too will increase in damage the more you use it.\n"
" \n"

"- Most of the ship movement in this game is confined to the world map. This is where you control your vessel and decide which locations to visit.\n"
" \n"
"- Your ship's moves will be replenished when they reach zero. Since there are no active enemy units on the world map, ending the turn is not necessary. However you may encounter hidden random encounters whilst at sea. Sail close to islands to best avoid these.\n"
" \n"
"- Most locations are present on the world map at the start of the game. Some locations only appear as a result of certain events or dialogue.\n"
" \n"
"- The weapons displayed on your deck (cannon, ballista, mortar, etc) represent your ship's attacks. They are only decorations and cannot be interacted with.\n"
" \n"
"- The colour of the island labels indicate the danger level. Yellow represents a slight threat or a skirmish, orange a decent-sized battle, red a very tough battle. Islands with green labels contain very little or no combat. This colour-code system allows you to ensure you do not stumble into battles without enough gold.\n"
" \n"
"- Once a scenario has been completed the state of play in that location will be modified to reflect the outcome of the scenario. For instance, liberating an island occupied by the royals may allow another faction to take power.\n"
" \n"
"- Returning to previous locations can be useful. Often there will be NPCs to speak with or trades and recruits to be had. The story state of some islands are also affected by hidden events.\n"
