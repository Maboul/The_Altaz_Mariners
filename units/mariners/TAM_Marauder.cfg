    description= _ "Largo was always the rash one. Quick to pick a fight, and quick to finish them. Though his temper often landed him in trouble, his brother Hugo was always around to pick up the pieces.

His raw strength and headfirst style meant a mace was always Largo's weapon of choice. He later learned more practical ways of fighting, but swinging a blunt piece of iron at his enemies remains his favourite.

In the absense of a father, Largo looked up to Marco with admiration and a touch of jealously. His brother's betrayal set a fire burning in his heart that drives him on, sometimes in rage."
